# Fabric Example Mod
   
## notes

this is a client-side only mod. however, there is a server-side plugin https://github.com/lukeludlow/SilhouetteSpigot
that enables you to display player outlines beyond normal render distance. 
this is helpful because you probably want to see player outlines when you're very far away.

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.
