# Fabric Example Mod

## todo 
   
[] keybind to quickly enable/disable silhouettes
[] custom glow (color, intensity, whatever else i can figure out)
[] bright/clearer gamertags 
[] smooth scaling of gamertag size
[] render outline beyond normal player render distance (e.g. on multiplayer server)

## notes

this is a client-side only mod. however, there is a server-side companion mod that 
enables you to display player outlines beyond normal render distance. 
this is helpful because you might want to see a player's outline when you're very far away.

if so
